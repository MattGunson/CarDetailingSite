# CarDetailingSite
### Elevator Pitch
Small business owners face two significant issues, creating an effective and efficient 
order/fulfillment tracking process and creating a digital platform that establishes trust with the
end user and serves as a landing for any web generated leads. This product is a customizable website
for small business owners/hustlers that provides a subscription service platform to hook into our
website. As a proof of concept this website will be designed to cater to a small business that 
provides detailing services to professionals who commute to the office and leave their car in the
parking lot while they're working. Features will include a live update of the technicians location
just before and during time of service displayed on a map, as well as scheduling, pricing, and 
account creation.
