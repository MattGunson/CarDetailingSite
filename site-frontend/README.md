This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Startup Service

I had a conversation with the professor at the beginning of the semester that I would be using Next.js. He said that it would be fine. By using Next
my frontend is served up using a combination of static and dynamic requests to my next server. I have implemented some authentication middleware using
third pary requests to add authentication using google. I also use third party requests to generate dummy data. Because my assets and frontend are being
generated by my backend there is no opportunity for them to make calls back to the backend.

## Startup Javascript

I also didn't get any credit for `Startup JavaScript`. If you could grade that as well that would be appreciated. I added support for login, but it is still under review. I'm hoping that I can cleanup the code for authentication as it takes approval from google to use GoogleAuth. I'm also not sure that Next.js and websockets are compatible, so it will be interesting to see if there is a third party service or workaround that I can use. I do have javascript serving my files and use await fetch() to  get new data.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
